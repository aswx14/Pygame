Flappy Bird Clone in Pygame

Description

This is a simple Flappy Bird clone built using Pygame. The game features a bird that the player controls by pressing the spacebar to make it jump. The objective is to navigate through randomly generated pipes without colliding with them. The game continues until the bird collides with a pipe or the ground.

Features

Smooth bird movement with gravity and jumping mechanics
Randomized pipes with gaps to navigate through
Scrolling ground to enhance visual appeal
Score counter to track progress
Game Over screen when the bird collides with an obstacle

Controls

Press SPACEBAR to make the bird jump.
The bird automatically falls due to gravity.
Avoid hitting the pipes and the ground.

How the Code Works

Bird Class: Manages the player's character (bird), its movement, and collision detection.
Pipe Class: Generates pipes with random heights that move left across the screen.
Ground Class: Simulates a scrolling ground effect.
Game Loop: Handles event detection, updating objects, collision checks, and rendering.
